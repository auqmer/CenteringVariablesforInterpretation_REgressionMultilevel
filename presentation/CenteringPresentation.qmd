### R Documentation

#### Motor Trend Car Road Tests

##### Description

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973--74 models).

##### Format

A data frame with 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.

\[, 1\] *mpg* - Miles/(US) gallon\
\[, 2\] *cyl* - Number of cylinders\
\[, 3\] *disp* - Displacement (cu.in.)\
\[, 4\] *hp* - Gross horsepower\
\[, 5\] *drat* - Rear axle ratio\
\[, 6\] *wt* - Weight (1000 lbs)\
\[, 7\] *qsec* - 1/4 mile time\
\[, 8\] *vs* - Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)\
\[, 9\] *am* - Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)\
\[,10\] *gear* - Number of forward gears\
\[,11\] *carb* - Number of carburetors

##### Note

Henderson and Velleman (1981) comment in a footnote to Table 1: 'Hocking \[original transcriber\]'s noncrucial coding of the Mazda's rotary engine as a straight six-cylinder engine and the Porsche's flat engine as a V engine, as well as the inclusion of the diesel Mercedes 240D, have been retained to enable direct comparisons to be made with previous analyses.'

##### Examples

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
require(graphics)
pairs(mtcars, main = "mtcars data", gap = 1/4)
coplot(mpg ~ disp | as.factor(cyl), data = mtcars,
       panel = panel.smooth, rows = 1)
## possibly more meaningful, e.g., for summary() or bivariate plots:
mtcars2 <- within(mtcars, {
   vs <- factor(vs, labels = c("V", "S"))
   am <- factor(am, labels = c("automatic", "manual"))
   cyl  <- ordered(cyl)
   gear <- ordered(gear)
   carb <- ordered(carb)
})
summary(mtcars2)
[Package datasets version 4.2.2 Index]
```

## Exploring mtcars Data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(psych)
pairs.panels(mtcars[ , c("mpg", "hp", "wt") ])
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
describe(mtcars[ , c("mpg", "hp", "wt")], fast = TRUE)
```

## Mean Centering

-   Mean centering entails subtracting the mean value from each raw value

-   For example, because the mean horsepower in our sample is 146.7, we would subtract that value from each car's hp.

-   in R :

```{r}
mtcars$c_hp <- mtcars$hp - mean(mtcars$hp)

describe(mtcars[ , c("hp", "c_hp")], fast = TRUE)
```

## Plotting raw and centered hp

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(mtcars$hp, main = "Uncentered Horsepower")
abline(v = mean(mtcars$hp), col = "red")
hist(mtcars$c_hp, main = "Mean Centered Horsepower")
abline(v = mean(mtcars$c_hp), col = "red")
```

## Mean Centering in Additive Regression Models

```{r}
library(texreg)
```

```{r, results='asis', echo=TRUE}
mean_ctr <- function(x) {x - mean(x)}

model_uncentered <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt, data = mtcars)
model_centered <- lm(mpg ~ mean_ctr(hp) + mean_ctr(wt), data = mtcars)

htmlreg(list(model_uncentered, model_centered), 
        single.row = TRUE, 
        custom.model.names = c("uncentered", "centered"))
```

## Centering with Interaction

```{r, results='asis'}
model_x <- lm(mpg ~ hp * wt, data = mtcars)
model_centeredx <- lm(mpg ~ mean_ctr(hp)*mean_ctr(wt), data = mtcars)
htmlreg(list(model_x, model_centeredx), single.row = TRUE, custom.model.names = c("uncentered", "centered"))
```

## Myths about Centering[@Dalal2011Somecommonmyths]

![](CommonMythsCentering.png)

## Summary of Centering in Multiple Regression

-   Centering can improve interpretability of the model intercept
    -   Useful with continuous variables where zero is not meaningful
    -   Not useful for categorical variables (when dummy coded)
-   Less useful with interactions (moderation)
-   Does Not change global fit of the model ($R^2$) or statistical significance of coefficients.

## General Centering Issues im Multilevel Modeling

-   Centering can make intercepts more meaningful, just as with single level regression.
-   But, multilevel model are invariant to linear transformations only if there are no random slopes.
-   Level 1 predictors in MLM can be centered at the grand mean (CGM) or centered within clusters (CWC).
-   Centering level 2 predictors is fairly straightforward, and done similarly to centering in multiple regression (e.g. CGM; CWC is not possible because level 2 predictors are constant within clusters).

## Types of Centering

1.  **Grand Mean Centering (CGM)** - subtract the sample mean from each value of a variable.
2.  **Group Mean Centering (CWC)** - subtract the group mean from each member of that group.
3.  You can also center around any other meaningful value.

## Grand Mean Centering

-   The intercept is interpreted as the expected value of the outcome variable, when all the predictors are at their mean (if you grand mean center all the predictors).

## Group Mean Centering

-   Disentangles level 1 and level 3 correlation between predictor(s) and outcome.

-   CWC level 1 variables are not correlated with level 2 variables

## Centering in R

```{r, echo = TRUE}
welldat <- read.csv(file = "../data/welldata.csv", header = TRUE)

welldat <- within(welldat, {
  size.f <- factor(size)
  hours.cgm <- hours - mean(hours) # Centering by grand mean
  hours.cwc <- hours - ave(hours, size, FUN = mean) # ctr within cluster
  hours.xbar <- mean(hours) # group mean (constant vector)
})

head(welldat)
```

## Which to Use: CGM or CWC?

-   The choice should be based on the nature of the research questions.

## A Multilevel Example from @Enders2007Centeringpredictorvariables

*wellbeing* - psychological well being (level 1)

*hours* - number of work hours per week (level 1)

*size* - workgroup (organization) size

## Correlation between Wellbeing and Hours is confounded across levels

```{r, fig.height=5}
welldat <- read.csv(file = "../data/welldata.csv", header = TRUE)

welldat <- within(welldat, {
  size.f <- factor(size)
  hours.cgm <- hours - mean(hours)
  hours.cwc <- hours - ave(hours, size, FUN = mean)
  hours.xbar <- mean(hours)
  hours.xbarj <- ave(hours, size, FUN = mean)
  hours.xbarjc <- hours.xbarj - mean(hours.xbarj)
  wellbeing.ybar <- mean(wellbeing)
})
plot(wellbeing ~ hours, data = welldat, pch = welldat$size, 
     col = welldat$size,
     main = "Level 1 data")
```

```{r}
plot(ave(wellbeing, size, FUN = mean) ~ 
       ave(hours, size, FUN = mean), ylim = c(40, 77), xlim = c(30, 70),
     data = welldat, pch = welldat$size, main = "Level 2 Data (group means)", col = welldat$size)
```

## Summary of CGM vs CWC Centering

-   CGM produced an intercept value that was interpreted as the average adjusted mean, whereas the CWC intercept value was the average unadjusted mean.

-   The centered scores under CGM contained both within- and between-cluster variation, resulting in a regression slope that was an ambiguous mixture of the Level 1 (e.g., person level) and Level 2 (e.g., organization level) association between X and Y.

-   In contrast, centered scores under CWC were uncorrelated with Level 2 variables, so the resulting regression coefficient was a pure estimate of the Level 1 relationship between X and Y.

## Variance Components

The choice of centering also affected the interpretation of the variance components.

-   The CGM estimate of the intercept variance quantified variation in the adjusted means (i.e., variation in the outcome means, having controlled for the Level 1 predictor), whereas the CWC variance estimate captured variation in the unadjusted means.

-   There are differences in the estimates of the slope variation between centering methods

-   Potential problems associated with the CGM estimate of the slope variance.

## A Level 1 Predictor Is of Substantive Interest

-   CWC may be the most appropriate form of centering in situations in which the primary substantive interest involves a Level 1 (i.e., person level) predictor.

-   CWC removes all between-cluster variation from the predictor and yields a "pure" estimate of the pooled within-cluster (i.e., Level 1) regression coefficient.

## A Level 2 Predictor Is of Substantive Interest

-   CGM is the method of choice for assessing the impact of cluster-level variables, controlling for Level 1 covariates.

-   CWC does not control for the effects of Level 1 covariates and thus would be inappropriate in this scenario.

## It Is of Interest to Examine a Predictor's Influence at Two Levels

-   In order to test whether a predictor has a differential effect at both levels of the hierarchy, we must use the individual scores and the cluster means as predictors in the model.

-   in this situation either form of centering (CGM or CWC) is appropriate

## An Interaction Effect Is of Substantive Interest

-   Here the focus in on cross-level interactions, when a Level 2 variable moderates the magnitude of a Level 1 relationship.

-   For example, suppose that group size (an organization-level variable) moderated the relationship between workload and well-being (the person- level regression), such that the association between workload and well-being was weaker in small workgroups.

-   CGM has been shown to be problematic in this situation due to confounding of Level 1 and 2.

-   CWC disentangles this confounding and is preferred in this situation

## What about interactions between level 1 predictors?

-   CWC is also best for interactions between level 1 predictors.

-   a cross-level interaction and an in- teraction involving a pair of Level 1 variables both require an accurate estimate of the Level 1 slope because this coefficient is being moderated by another predictor.
